# Pneumonia-Detector

Pneumonia Detector is a web application that allows users to upload an X-ray image of a chest to determine if one has pneumonia or not. The app employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow to solve this classification problem: more specifically, the CNN model is a fine-tuned version of the pre-trained VGG-16 model.

The web application's frontend is constructed with React (TypeScript).
